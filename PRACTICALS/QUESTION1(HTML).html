        <P style="font-size:150%";><B>HTML</B>(<i>HyperText Markup Language</i>) is the most basic building block of the Web. 

        It defines the <b><i>meaning and structure of web content</i></b>. 
            
        Other technologies besides <b>HTML</b> are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</P>


        <P style="font-size:150%";><u>"Hypertext"</u>refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. 
        
        Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, 
        
        you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</P>

        
        <P style="font-size:150%";><b>HTML</b> can embed programs written in a scripting language such as <b><i>JavaScript</i></b>, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. 
        
        Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.
        
        <br> The <b><i>World Wide Web Consortium</i></b> <b>(W3C)</b>, former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards,
        
        has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational <i><b>HTML since 1997</b></i>.
